# Selection-Sort-MIPS-assembly

MIPS assembly program to initialize registers as hard-coded below:

$s0 to 8

$s1 to 12

$s2 to 5

$s3 to 2 

Then, store:

register $s0 in the first element of an array, 

register $s1 in the second element of the array, 

register $s2 in the third element of the array, and 

register $s3 in the fourth element of the array. 

Then, sort the elements of the array using the selection sort algorithm, and display the sorted array.
